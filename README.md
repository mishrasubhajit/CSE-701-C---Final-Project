# CSE-701-C---Final-Project

1. This is a basic RSA encryption algorithm written for the purpose of CSE 701 project. This is by no means a program that can be commercially used.

2. The BigInt class I have used is taken from [here](https://github.com/srndic/rsa/blob/master/source/BigInt.cpp). A few changes were to made to accomodate my program and a few wrrors were resolved.

3. This is my first time programming. It is evident that the program is not sophisticated.
